    <title>The Migration of Birds</title>
    <h3>The Migration of Birds</h3>
    <p>One day, as you were flying your plane, you decided to test the limits and push farther into the clouds than you ever have... </p>
    
    <p>Suddenly, you stumbled upon a floating civilization residing in the clouds. After talking to the locals, you learned that you were witnessing a once-in-a-million-year eventâ€”the migration of the sky birds. The clouds gently parted, revealing a sky filled with thousands of birds you'd never seen before. Their feathers shimmered in soft, unusual colors, and some had graceful, elongated wings that seemed to dance through the air. The sight was accompanied by a chorus of intricate bird songs, unlike anything you'd heard on the ground. The cloud dwellers explained that these hidden birds only pass through our world every million years, traveling secret routes known only to them. Most people live their entire lives without seeing this quiet spectacle. As you watched the birds glide by, you felt a gentle sense of amazement, knowing you were one of the few to witness this rare, beautiful journey.</p>
        
    <p>For the Awesomeness point, I used instancing for the waterfall and Yuka AI for the birds </p>
